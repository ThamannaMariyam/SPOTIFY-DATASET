##  Steps Followed

1. **Data Import**: Uploaded the `Spotify.csv` dataset into Power BI Desktop.
2. **Data Profiling**: Enabled `Column distribution`, `Column quality`, and `Column profile` under the *View* tab for better understanding.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Changed column data types.
   - Identified and retained error rows for investigation before removing them.
   - Removed duplicate records.
   - Replaced null values with appropriate defaults.
4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Created a custom `Date` column using release year, month, and day.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Designed interactive visuals using bar charts, line charts, donut charts, and cards.
